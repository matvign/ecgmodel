# PyQt vs tkinter
PyQt looks nice and has a more comfortable set of widgets to program in.
It also has excellent documentation (albeit written in C++).


# Building ECG
An ECG is generated by using the equations as described in this 
[paper](http://web.mit.edu/~gari/www/papers/ieeetbe50p289.pdf).

The current implementation does not incorporate noise.


# Alpha-Beta Filter primer
The alpha-beta filter is a family of filters that attempts to produce the
actual value of a system given unreliable data.

The filter is what we're trying to model. The state is the configuration of the
system. Prediction and updating is known as system propogation. 

A prediction is known as a prior and is produced from a process error. Process 
error is some uncertainty about the system.

1. Initialize initial state
2. Predict step: predict next state using process model (w/noise)
3. Take measurement of state
4. Adjust predicted state using measurement

## Bayesian Filter
A type of alpha-beta filter that utilizes probability. Create an array of
probabilities of an event occuring. 

Given a measurement, assign probability of what state something might be in.
Proceed with next measurement and update your previous state using probability.

When adding noise to probabilities also normalize the entire array, since we 
need probability to add up to one.

## Kalman Filter
The Kalman filter is a Bayesian filter that uses gaussian distributions.

A gaussian distribution converges on a point given random samples.
This can be applied to random noise by using an average.

### Terminology and Symbols
```
x_k: state
y_k/P_k: covariance matrix, observation vector/matrix

w_k: process noise from prediction step
Q_k: covariance matrix for prediction step

v_k: measurement noise from update step
R_k: covariance matrix for update step

f(): process model wo/noise
g(): measurement wo/noise

x_hat: desired reference point for linear estimate
y_hat: desired reference point for linear estimate
z_hat: desired reference point for linear estimate

Underline: no specific meaning
Overline: mean
Transpose (T): convert row into column e.g. [1 2 3] => [1; 2; 3]
Hat (^): variable with desired reference point
Prior (-): estimate of the state vector using previous states
Post (+): estimate after performing update step

The state is [x y z]
The observation is [0 0 1] * x_k + v_k with R_k = E{v_k v_k^T}
```
